## 👩‍💻 About the project
 
 Time management application, inspired by the pomodoro technique.  With the option of 'history' for consultation of tasks and time spent!
 
 Project built during [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) ReactJS course, where I was able to deepen my knowledge of this front-end library
